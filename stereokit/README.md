### About
StereoKit prioritizes mixed reality application development above all else! This allows us to focus on features such as a first class mixed reality input system, fast performance by default even on mobile devices, quick iteration time on-device, and a runtime asset pipeline that lets users and developers load real assets from the file-system. All of this and more are packaged in a terse API that’s well documented, easy to learn, and easy to write.

StereoKit is ready to use, but still early in its life! Keep track on Twitter for development news and gifs, or check this blog for more substantial updates! Can’t find a feature you need for your project? Request it on the issues page, and we’ll prioritize getting you up and running!

While StereoKit is primarily intended to be consumed from C#, all core functionality is implemented in native code, and a C compatible header file is also available for C/C++ developers!
These bindings are created from that header file!

## Getting Started

To get started with an android-setup template use

`cargo generate MalekiRe/stereokit-template`

If you don't have cargo generate first run

`cargo install cargo-generate`

### Example

```rust
fn basic() {
    let sk = crate::SettingsBuilder::new()
        .app_name("StereoKit Example App")
        .init()
        .unwrap();
    let model = sk.model_create_mesh(crate::Mesh::CUBE, crate::Material::DEFAULT);
    let mut position = glam::Vec3::default();
    let mut redness = 0.0;
    sk.run(|sk| {
        position.x = sk.time_total_f32().sin();
        position.y = sk.time_total_f32().cos();
        redness = sk.time_total_f32().sin() - 0.3;
        sk.model_draw(
            &model,
            glam::Mat4::from_scale_rotation_translation(
                glam::Vec3::new(1.0, 1.0, 1.0),
                glam::Quat::IDENTITY,
                position,
            ),
            crate::Color128::new(redness, 0.1, 0.9, 1.0),
            crate::RenderLayer::default(),
        );
    }, |_| {});
}
```
